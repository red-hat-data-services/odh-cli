## Self-Review (Mandatory)

Before ANY response containing code, analysis, or recommendations:

1. **Pause and re-read your work**
2. **Ask yourself:**
    - "What would a senior engineer critique?"
    - "What edge case am I missing?"
    - "Is this actually correct?"
    - "Does it follow development and architecture rules?"
3. **Fix issues before responding**
4. **Note significant fixes**: "Self-review: [what you caught]"
5. **If there is significant work, recommend the steps to fix it**

This self-review step is NOT optional. 
Taking an extra 30 seconds to review prevents wasted time from incorrect implementations.
